# systeminfo

A highly configurable and performance-optimized shell script for displaying key system information upon login. 

Inspired by tools like `htop` and `atop`, `systeminfo` gives you a quick, comprehensive snapshot of your server's state the moment you connect.

## About The Project
`systeminfo` was created to solve a simple problem: getting a quick yet thorough overview of a server's health right after logging in via SSH. Instead of running multiple commands (`df -h`, `free -m`, `uptime`, etc.), you get everything in one clean, readable report.

### Key features include:
* Comprehensive Overview: From CPU load to Docker containers, get all the vital stats in one place.
* High Performance: Uses parallel execution for slow operations (like network requests) to ensure the script runs in a fraction of a second.
* Highly Configurable: You can choose exactly which information blocks to display by passing simple arguments.
* Cross-Distro Compatibility: Designed to work on a wide range of Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, etc.) by gracefully handling missing commands and tools.
* Easy Installation: A simple one-liner gets you up and running in seconds.

## Features
`systeminfo` is divided into modular blocks, each providing specific information. You can choose which blocks to display when running the script.

### Default Blocks (Fast & Always On)

These blocks are displayed by default as they are fast and rely on core system utilities.

| Key   | Block Name          | Description                                                              |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| date  | Date & Time         | Current system date and time.                                            |
| cpu   | CPU Info            | CPU model, core count, load average, and current utilization percentage. |
| gpu   | GPU Info            | GPU model, temperature, and utilization (requires `nvidia-smi`).         |
| mem   | Memory Usage        | RAM and Swap usage (total, used, available/free).                        |
| sys   | System Info         | OS, kernel, architecture, and hostname.                                  |
| up    | Uptime              | How long the system has been running.                                    |
| df    | Disk Usage          | Filesystem usage, excluding temporary and loop devices.                  |
| net   | Network IPs         | Local IP addresses for all network interfaces.                           |
| pubip | Public IP           | The server's public-facing IP address.                                   |
| traf  | Network Traffic     | Total received (Rx) and transmitted (Tx) data for network interfaces.    |
| users | User Info           | Currently logged-in users (`who`) and recent logins (`last`).            |
| top   | Top Processes (CPU) | The top 3 processes consuming the most CPU.                              |
| dckr  | Docker Info         | A list of currently running Docker containers.                           |

### Optional Blocks (Slower or More Specific)
These blocks are not shown by default as they can be slower or require special permissions/tools.

| Key   | Block Name          | Description                                                                       |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| io    | I/O Activity        | Disk read/write activity (requires `iostat` from `sysstat` package).              |
| ports | Listening Ports     | A list of open TCP/UDP ports and the processes listening on them (requires `ss`). |
| updt  | Package Updates     | The number of available system updates (for APT or DNF).                          |
| fails | Failed Logins       | The last few failed login attempts (requires `lastb` and often `sudo`).           |
| topm  | Top Processes (Mem) | The top 3 processes consuming the most Memory.                                    |

## Installation
### Quick Install (Recommended)
This command will download the script, place it in /usr/local/bin, and make it executable.
```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/systeminfo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romantelychko/systeminfo/main/systeminfo \
    && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/systeminfo
```

### Auto-run on Login
To have systeminfo run every time you log in via SSH, add it to your shell's profile file.
```bash
echo -e "\nsysteminfo\n" >> ~/.profile
```

Note: Depending on your system, you might need to use `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_login` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

## Usage
Running the script is simple and flexible.

### Default View
To get the standard set of fast information blocks, just run the command:
```bash
systeminfo
```

### Custom View
To display only specific blocks, provide their keys as a comma-separated list with a - prefix.

#### Example 1: Show only CPU and Memory usage
```bash
systeminfo -cpu,mem
```

#### Example 2: Show all default blocks plus disk I/O activity and available updates
(The script is smart enough to show the default blocks in addition to the ones you request).
```bash
systeminfo -io,updt
```

#### Example 3: Show all available blocks
To see a complete report with every possible information block, use:
```bash
systeminfo -date,cpu,gpu,mem,sys,up,df,net,pubip,traf,users,top,dckr,io,ports,updt,fails,topm
```

## Dependencies
For full functionality, some blocks require external tools. 
The script will safely skip any block if its dependencies are not met.

* `io`: Requires iostat.
  * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install sysstat`
  * Fedora/CentOS: `sudo dnf install sysstat`
* `gpu`: Requires nvidia-smi for NVIDIA GPUs. 
  * Install the official NVIDIA drivers.
* `fails`: Requires `lastb`, which is usually included in util-linux. May require `sudo` permissions.
* `cpu%`: Requires bc for calculations.
  * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install bc`
  * Fedora/CentOS: `sudo dnf install bc`
